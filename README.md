Golang Dojo⛩️
====

This repository is a collection of my personal exercises and projects in Go.

I'm a firm believer in learning by doing, and this is where I practice and hone my skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in this dojo:

### [Go Channels](src/channels/)

This section contains examples of idiomatic ways to use Go channels for concurrency.
My own exercises to understand how to handle concurrent operations effectively in Go.

### [OpenAPI Generator Example](src/openapi/)

An example of how to generate a Golang HTTP server from an OpenAPI specification using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators).

This project demonstrates how to streamline REST API development by using code generation.

### [Rate Limiter Service](src/rate-limiter/)

A simple implementation of a rate limiter service.

This project is a practical example of how to control the rate of incoming requests to a service, which is a common requirement in web applications.
