OpenAPI Go Web App Example
====

OpenAPI is the standard for documenting RESTful API for web applications and services. A well-documented
API not only makes life easier for end-user to understand and consume, but also helps greatly with
development, and testing.

OpenAPI compatible toolchains also helps generating code for your server / client applications,
so as to keep good consistency between your openAPI definition and implementation.

This example demos an example Go webapp in [Gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) framework
as well as a cli command line in Python.
